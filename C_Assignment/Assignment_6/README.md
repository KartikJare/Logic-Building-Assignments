1. Assigment6Question1.c
Description: Accepts a number from the user and classifies it as "Small" (if less than 50), "Medium" (if between 50 and 100), or "Greater" (if greater than 100).

Function: Number(int iNo) - Classifies the input number and prints the result.

Usage: Enter a number, and the program will display its classification.

2. Assigment6Question2.c
Description: Accepts a single-digit number from the user and prints its word representation (e.g., "One" for 1). Handles negative numbers by converting them to positive.

Function: Dipaly(int iNo) - Converts the input digit to its word form or prints "Invalid Number" for non-single-digit inputs.

Usage: Enter a single-digit number, and the program will display its word equivalent.

3. Assigment6Question3.c
Description: Accepts a number from the user and calculates its factorial. Handles negative numbers by converting them to positive.

Function: Factorial(int iNo) - Computes the factorial of the input number.

Usage: Enter a number, and the program will display its factorial.

4. Assigment6Question4.c
Description: Accepts a number from the user and displays its multiplication table from 1 to 10. Handles negative numbers by converting them to positive.

Function: Table(int iNo) - Prints the multiplication table of the input number.

Usage: Enter a number, and the program will display its multiplication table.

5. Assigment6Question5.c
Description: Accepts a number from the user and displays its multiplication table in reverse order (from 10 to 1). Handles negative numbers by converting them to positive.

Function: Table(int iNo) - Prints the reverse multiplication table of the input number.

Usage: Enter a number, and the program will display its multiplication table in reverse order.

Notes
Error Handling: Programs like Assigment6Question2.c include checks for invalid inputs (non-single-digit numbers).

Negative Numbers: Programs such as Assigment6Question3.c, Assigment6Question4.c, and Assigment6Question5.c handle negative inputs by converting them to positive values before processing.
