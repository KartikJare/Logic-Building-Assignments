programAQ4.c	Accepts a number and counts the frequency of the digit 4 in it.

🛠️ Compilation & Execution
To compile and run any of the programs, use the following commands in your terminal:

gcc programAQ1.c -o programAQ1
./programAQ1

Replace programAQ1.c with the desired program’s filename.

📌 Notes:
All programs use scanf for input and printf for displaying output.

Basic loop and conditional logic is applied for digit manipulation.

Negative inputs are handled by converting them to positive before processing.

The same function name CountTwo is reused in multiple files with different logic — consider refactoring for clarity in future enhancements.
