1. Assigment7Question1.c
Description: Accepts a number from the user and displays a pattern consisting of * followed by # repeated for the given number of times.

Function: Display(int iNo) - Prints the pattern * repeated iNo times followed by # repeated iNo times.

Usage: Enter a number, and the program will display the pattern (e.g., for input 3: ***###).

2. Assigment7Question2.c
Description: Accepts an amount in US dollars and converts it to Indian Rupees (INR) using a fixed conversion rate of 1 USD = 70 INR.

Function: DollarToInr(int iNo) - Converts the input USD amount to INR.

Usage: Enter a USD amount, and the program will display the equivalent INR value.

3. Assigment7Question3.c
Description: Accepts a number from the user and calculates its even factorial (product of all even numbers up to the input number). Handles negative numbers by converting them to positive.

Function: EvenFactorial(int iNo) - Computes the even factorial of the input number.

Usage: Enter a number, and the program will display its even factorial.

4. Assigment7Question4.c
Description: Accepts a number from the user and calculates its odd factorial (product of all odd numbers up to the input number). Handles negative numbers by converting them to positive.

Function: OddFactorial(int iNo) - Computes the odd factorial of the input number.

Usage: Enter a number, and the program will display its odd factorial.

5. Assigment7Question5.c
Description: Accepts a number from the user and returns the difference between its even factorial and odd factorial.

Function: FactorialDiff(int iNo) - Computes the difference between the even factorial and odd factorial of the input number.

Usage: Enter a number, and the program will display the difference between its even and odd factorials.

Notes:

Pattern Printing: Assigment7Question1.c demonstrates simple pattern generation.

Currency Conversion: Assigment7Question2.c uses a fixed conversion rate; update the rate as needed.

Factorial Calculations: Programs like Assigment7Question3.c, Assigment7Question4.c, and Assigment7Question5.c handle negative inputs by converting them to positive values before processing.
