File Operations in C
This repository contains C programs demonstrating basic file operations such as opening, creating, reading, writing, and appending to files.

Programs Overview
1. programAQ1.c - Open File in Read Mode
Description: Accepts a filename from the user and opens the file in read-only mode.

Usage:

bash
./programAQ1
Enter the filename when prompted.

Output: Displays whether the file was opened successfully along with the file descriptor.

2. programAQ2.c - Create a File
Description: Accepts a filename from the user and creates the file with read, write, and execute permissions for all.

Usage:

bash
./programAQ2
Enter the filename when prompted.

Output: Confirms if the file was created successfully along with the file descriptor.

3. programAQ3.c - Read and Display File Contents
Description: Accepts a filename from the user, reads the entire content of the file, and displays it on the screen.

Usage:

bash
./programAQ3
Enter the filename when prompted.

Output: Shows the file contents if opened successfully.

4. programAQ4.c - Display File Size
Description: Accepts a filename from the user and displays the size of the file in bytes.

Note: The implementation for this program is not provided in the repository. You may need to implement it using stat system call or by reading the file and counting bytes.

5. programAQ5.c - Append String to File
Description: Accepts a filename and appends the string "Hello World" to the end of the file.

Usage:

bash
./programAQ5
Enter the filename when prompted.

Output: Confirms the number of bytes written successfully.

Compilation Instructions
To compile each program, use the following command (replace programAQX.c with the actual filename):

bash
gcc programAQX.c -o programAQX
Execution
After compilation, run the executable:

bash
./programAQX
