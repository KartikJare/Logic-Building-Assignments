# C Programming Assignments

This repository contains a collection of C programs written by Kartik Ganesh Jare. Each program serves a specific purpose and demonstrates basic programming concepts.

## Programs Overview

### 1. Division of Two Numbers
- **File:** `programAQ1.c`
- **Description:** This program divides two numbers and handles division by zero by returning `-1`.
- **Usage:** The `Divide` function takes two integers and returns their quotient. If the divisor is zero, it returns `-1`.

### 2. Printing "Marvellous" Five Times
- **File:** `programAQ2.c`
- **Description:** This program prints the word "Marvellous" five times on the screen using a loop.
- **Usage:** The `Display` function is called from `main` to achieve this.

### 3. Printing Numbers from 5 to 1
- **File:** `programAQ3.c`
- **Description:** This program prints numbers from 5 to 1 in descending order using a `while` loop.
- **Usage:** The `Diplay` function (note the typo in the function name) is called from `main`.

### 4. Divisibility Check by 5
- **File:** `programAQ4.c`
- **Description:** This program checks if a given number is divisible by 5 using a custom `BOOL` type.
- **Usage:** The user inputs a number, and the `Check` function returns `TRUE` (1) if divisible by 5, otherwise `FALSE` (-1).

### 5. Printing Asterisks
- **File:** `programAQ5.c`
- **Description:** This program prints a specified number of asterisks (`*`), each on a new line.
- **Usage:** The `Accept` function takes an integer and prints `*` that many times. The default value used is 5.

## How to Compile and Run
1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`).
2. Compile each program using the command:  
   ```bash
   gcc <filename.c> -o <outputname>
